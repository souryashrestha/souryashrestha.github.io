I am a postdoctoral research fellow at 
<a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.jhsph.edu" target="_blank"> Johns Hopkins School of Public Heath</a> in Baltimore, USA.
My <a style="text-decoration:none" href="research.html"> research</a>, very broadly, focuses on the dynamics of infectious diseases.
I use mathematical and computational models, along with data and statistical tools to understand the roles of 
potential drivers in the transmission of infectious diseases, and how to effectively and efficaciously control 
the transmission of various infectious pathogens, such as dengue virus, pneumococcus and <i> mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>.
I am currently working with <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/5157/Dowdy/David_W." target="_blank">Dr. David Dowdy</a>, to investigate the roles of new drug regimens and drug susceptibility testing on proliferation of  drug-resistant TB and targeted distribution of adult vaccines of TB.

I recieved my PhD. in <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/aim-grad/" target="_blank"> Applied & Interdisciplinary Mathematics</a>
from <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.umich.edu" target="_blank"> University of Michigan</a> in Ann Arbor.
I was a postdoctoral fellow in the <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/eeb" target="_blank"> Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology</a>, 
and the <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://cscs.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Studies of Complex Systems</a> at University of Michigan, where I worked closely with Drs <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/faculty/ci.rohanipej_ci.detail" target="_blank">Pejman Rohani</a> and <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/eeb/people/faculty/ci.kingaaron_ci.detail" target="_blank">Aaron A.
