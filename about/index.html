	<p> I am a Research Associate at <a style="text-decoration:none" href="http://www.jhsph.edu" target="_blank"> Johns Hopkins School of Public Heath</a> in Baltimore, USA.
My <a style="text-decoration:none" href="research.html"> research</a>, very broadly, focuses on the dynamics of infectious diseases.
I use mathematical and computational models, along with data and statistical tools to understand the roles of 
potential drivers in the transmission of infectious diseases, and how to effectively and efficaciously control 
the transmission of various infectious pathogens, such as dengue virus, pneumococcus and <i> mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>.
Some of my current projects include: (i) Transmission and control of TB in the US; 
(ii) Targeted distribution of adult vaccines of TB; (iii) HIV-TB interventions.
